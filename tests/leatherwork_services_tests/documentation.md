# Leatherworking Application Service Layer Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to write clear, robust, and maintainable tests for the service layer of the Leatherworking Application. Our tests are the first line of defense against bugs in business logic, data handling, and integration between the service and its underlying repositories.

## Testing Philosophy

When writing service layer tests, follow these core principles:

- **Isolation:**  
  Service tests must run in isolation of external dependencies. Use dependency injection and mocked repositories to control each test’s environment.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
  Cover all critical paths including:
  - Successful operations (CRUD)
  - Validation failures (e.g., missing fields)
  - Not-found scenarios and other exception cases

- **Realistic Data & Mocking:**  
  Create mock objects that closely simulate real entities. Use factories (or helper fixtures) for creating test instances and ensure consistency (e.g., all required fields are present).

- **Exact Business Logic Verification:**  
  Verify that the correct business rules apply when changes are made. For example, when updating or deleting, ensure that related checks (such as dependent sales or projects) are honored.

## Prerequisites

Before writing or running tests, ensure you have:
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) installed.
- An understanding of the service methods and their contracts.
- Access to the service layer implementation and any custom business rules.
- Familiarity with mocking utilities such as `MagicMock` and `SimpleNamespace`.

## Test Structure

### Organizing Your Tests

Structure your tests into classes and methods that mirror the features of your service. Each test file should focus on one service (e.g., CustomerService, HardwareService).

#### Example Structure for CustomerService

```python
class TestCustomerService:
    def test_create_customer_success(self, customer_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test successful customer creation with valid data."""
        # Arrange: Prepare valid customer data
        # Act: Call create() on the service
        # Assert: Check output and status values

    def test_create_customer_validation_error(self, customer_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test that creating a customer with missing required fields raises ValidationError."""
        # Arrange: Prepare invalid data
        # Act & Assert: Verify that ValidationError is raised

    def test_get_customer_by_id_success(self, customer_service_with_mock_repo, customer_repository_mock):
        """Test retrieving an existing customer by ID using a pre-configured mock."""
        # Use repository_helper such as set_next_mock() to control returned data.
```

#### Example Structure for HardwareService

```python
class TestHardwareService:
    def test_create_hardware_success(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test successful hardware creation with valid data."""
        # Arrange: Prepare a complete hardware data dict.
        # Act: Call create() on the hardware service.
        # Assert: Ensure the returned dictionary contains expected fields and values.

    def test_create_hardware_validation_error(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test that hardware creation with incomplete data raises ValidationError."""
        # Arrange: Prepare data with missing required fields.
        # Act & Assert: Verify that invoking create() raises ValidationError.

    def test_get_hardware_by_id_not_found(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test that requesting a non-existent hardware item raises NotFoundError."""
        # Act & Assert: Verify appropriate exception is raised when an ID is not found.
```

## Mocking Strategies

### Repository Mocking

Utilize both `SimpleNamespace` (for quick, immutable objects) and `MagicMock` (for more dynamic behavior):

- **Using SimpleNamespace (Recommended):**

  ```python
  from types import SimpleNamespace

  mock_hardware = SimpleNamespace(
      id=1,
      name='Brass Buckle',
      type='BUCKLE',
      material='BRASS',
      finish='POLISHED'
  )
  ```

- **Using MagicMock:**

  ```python
  from unittest.mock import MagicMock

  mock_hardware = MagicMock()
  mock_hardware.id = 1
  mock_hardware.name = 'Brass Buckle'
  mock_hardware.type = 'BUCKLE'
  ```

### Dependency Injection Fixtures

Ensure your fixtures provide not only the service instances but also the correctly mocked repositories. For instance:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def hardware_service_with_mock_repo(
    hardware_repository_mock, inventory_repository_mock, supplier_repository_mock
):
    """
    Creates a HardwareService instance with all necessary mocked repositories.
    
    Returns:
        An instance of HardwareService using mocked dependencies.
    """
    return MockServiceFactory.create_mock_service(
        repository_mock=hardware_repository_mock,
        inventory_repo_mock=inventory_repository_mock
    )
```

> **Tip:** When your repository mock uses a side effect (for example, a custom `get_by_id` that checks an internal `_last_mock`), always use the provided helper functions (such as `set_next_mock()`) rather than setting `return_value` directly.

## Test Coverage Recommendations

Cover the full range of service functionality:

1. **CRUD Operations:**

   - *Create:*  
     Test both successful creation and handling of missing or invalid inputs.
     
   - *Read:*  
     Test fetching by ID—including a positive test case and one where the entity is not found.
     
   - *Update:*  
     Test full and partial updates; include scenarios where the entity does not exist.
     
   - *Delete:*  
     Test basic deletion, and also cases where a deletion is blocked due to related dependencies (e.g., sales or projects).

2. **Business Logic Enforcement:**

   - Validate that required fields are present.
   - Ensure enums and status values are correctly processed.
   - Confirm that dependent relationships (like checking for related records before deletion) are correctly enforced.

3. **Search and Filtering:**

   - Test that search methods return lists of results.
   - Verify that additional filtering (by type, status, or tier) returns only matching items.

## Common Test Patterns

### Validation Error Checks

Always test that invalid data produces clear, expected errors. For example:

```python
def test_create_with_invalid_data(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
    """Expect ValidationError when required fields are missing."""
    invalid_data = {'type': 'BUCKLE'}  # Missing 'name', 'material', etc.
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError) as excinfo:
        hardware_service_with_mock_repo.create(invalid_data)
    assert 'Missing required field' in str(excinfo.value)
```

### Not Found Error Handling

```python
def test_get_non_existent_entity(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
    """Expect NotFoundError for a non-existent hardware ID."""
    with pytest.raises(NotFoundError):
        hardware_service_with_mock_repo.get_by_id(999999)
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Test Names:**  
  Make it clear what each test is checking; include the expected outcome in the test name.

- **Isolate Each Test:**  
  Each test should focus on a single unit of behavior. Use one assertion per test when practical to make failures easier to diagnose.

- **Prefer Factory Functions/Fixtures:**  
  Use factories or fixtures to generate test data so that tests remain maintainable and DRY.

- **Handle Edge Cases:**  
  Always consider boundary conditions and rarely tested scenarios.

- **Integrate Real Business Rules:**  
  Make sure your tests echo the business logic; avoid “over-mocking” that skips vital logic validation.

## Example Complete Test File

Below is an example for the HardwareService tests that follows the guidelines:

```python
import pytest
from database.models.enums import HardwareType, HardwareMaterial, HardwareFinish
from services.exceptions import ValidationError, NotFoundError

class TestHardwareService:
    def test_create_hardware_success(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test successful hardware creation with valid data."""
        hardware_data = {
            'name': 'Brass Buckle',
            'type': HardwareType.BUCKLE.value,
            'material': HardwareMaterial.BRASS.value,
            'finish': HardwareFinish.POLISHED.value,
            'size': '25mm',
            'description': 'High-quality brass buckle for leather projects'
        }
        created_hardware = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.create(hardware_data)
        assert created_hardware is not None
        assert created_hardware['name'] == 'Brass Buckle'
        assert created_hardware['type'] == HardwareType.BUCKLE.value
        assert created_hardware['material'] == HardwareMaterial.BRASS.value

    def test_create_hardware_validation_error(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test hardware creation with invalid data raises ValidationError."""
        invalid_hardware_data = {
            'type': HardwareType.BUCKLE.value  # Missing required fields such as 'name'
        }
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            hardware_service_with_mock_repo.create(invalid_hardware_data)

    def test_get_hardware_by_id_success(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test retrieving an existing hardware item by ID."""
        retrieved_hardware = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.get_by_id(1)
        assert retrieved_hardware is not None
        assert retrieved_hardware['id'] == 1

    def test_get_hardware_by_id_not_found(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test that retrieving a non-existent hardware item raises NotFoundError."""
        with pytest.raises(NotFoundError):
            hardware_service_with_mock_repo.get_by_id(999999)

    def test_update_hardware_success(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test successful hardware update."""
        update_data = {
            'name': 'Updated Brass Buckle',
            'finish': HardwareFinish.BRUSHED.value
        }
        updated_hardware = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.update(1, update_data)
        assert updated_hardware['name'] == 'Updated Brass Buckle'
        assert updated_hardware['finish'] == HardwareFinish.BRUSHED.value

    def test_delete_hardware_success(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test successful hardware deletion."""
        result = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.delete(1)
        assert result is True

    def test_search_hardware(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test searching for hardware items returns a list."""
        results = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.search('Buckle')
        assert isinstance(results, list)

    def test_get_by_type(self, hardware_service_with_mock_repo):
        """Test retrieving hardware items by type returns a list."""
        results = hardware_service_with_mock_repo.get_by_type(HardwareType.BUCKLE.value)
        assert isinstance(results, list)
```

## Continuous Improvement

- **Review Tests Regularly:**  
  As features change, update tests to match new business rules.

- **Monitor Code Coverage:**  
  Use code coverage tools to ensure your tests cover all critical paths.

- **Refactor When Needed:**  
  Keep tests clear and concise. Remove redundancy using shared fixtures and helper functions.
