# Dashboard and Analytics Integration Guide

## Overview

The dashboard serves as the central hub for the Leatherworking ERP system, providing at-a-glance visibility into key business metrics, recent activities, and upcoming deadlines. It integrates with the analytics system to offer actionable insights and quick navigation to detailed analytical views.

## Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard follows a modular design pattern with distinct sections for different types of information:

```
DashboardView
├── Header
├── KPI Section
├── Quick Actions
├── Recent Activities
├── Status Sections
│   ├── Inventory Status
│   ├── Project Status
│   └── Analytics Insights
└── Upcoming Deadlines
```

Each section is independently updatable and connects to its respective service for data retrieval.

## Key Features

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard displays four primary KPIs that give an immediate overview of business health:

- **Monthly Sales**: Current month's total sales with percentage change from previous month
- **Active Projects**: Number of active projects with completed projects this month
- **Inventory Value**: Total value of current inventory with low stock indicators
- **Pending Orders**: Number of pending purchase orders with total pending amount

KPIs include trend indicators (↑/↓) with appropriate coloring to quickly identify positive or negative changes.

### 2. Quick Actions

The Quick Actions section provides one-click access to common operations:

- **New Project**: Initiates the project creation workflow
- **New Sale**: Opens the sales entry form
- **Add Inventory**: Navigates to the inventory management view
- **New Purchase**: Opens the purchase order creation form

These actions are directly linked to the main application workflows for efficiency.

### 3. Recent Activities

The Recent Activities section displays a chronological list of the latest events in the system, including:

- Inventory changes
- Project status updates
- Sales transactions
- Purchase orders

Each activity is color-coded by type and double-clicking an activity navigates to the relevant detailed view.

### 4. Status Sections

#### Inventory Status

Provides a visual breakdown of inventory:
- Quick counts of items in stock, low stock, and out of stock
- Distribution chart showing inventory breakdown by category

#### Project Status

Shows project distribution and trends:
- Status indicators for planning, in-progress, and completed projects
- Project timeline or sales trend chart for performance analysis

#### Analytics Insights

Displays key metrics from the analytics system:
- Profit margin and customer retention rates
- Resource efficiency and average project completion time
- Quick links to detailed analytics views

### 5. Upcoming Deadlines

Displays cards for approaching deadlines and events:
- Project due dates
- Client meetings
- Order deadlines
- Material deliveries

## Data Integration

### Service Integration

The dashboard integrates with multiple services to gather and display data:

- **Inventory Service**: Provides inventory counts, values, and category distribution
- **Project Service**: Supplies project counts, status distribution, and upcoming deadlines
- **Sales Service**: Provides revenue figures, trends, and recent sales
- **Purchase Service**: Supplies purchase order information and pending amounts
- **Analytics Service**: Provides aggregated metrics and insights

### Error Handling

The dashboard implements robust error handling to ensure continuous operation:

1. Each data section loads independently, so failures in one service don't affect others
2. Placeholder data is used when services are unavailable
3. Detailed error logging helps identify and resolve issues
4. The refresh mechanism allows users to retry data loading when needed

## Analytics Integration

The dashboard serves as an entry point to the more detailed analytics system:

### Analytics Insights Section

The Analytics Insights section provides a summary of key metrics from the analytics system and serves as a gateway to more detailed analysis.

### Analytics Navigation

From the dashboard, users can access:

- **Analytics Dashboard**: A comprehensive overview of all analytics
- **Customer Analytics**: Segmentation, retention, and lifetime value analysis
- **Profitability Analytics**: Margin analysis and cost breakdowns
- **Material Usage Analytics**: Consumption patterns and waste analysis
- **Project Metrics**: Efficiency metrics and bottleneck identification

### Analytics Data Flow

1. The dashboard retrieves summary analytics data via the `IAnalyticsDashboardService`
2. Clicking on an analytics section navigates to the corresponding detailed view
3. The analytics views maintain their own filter state and refresh mechanisms
4. Analytics insights feed back into the main dashboard for quick reference

## Customization

The dashboard supports several customization options:

### Date Ranges

Analytics components support multiple time period selections:
- Last 30 Days
- Last 90 Days
- Last 6 Months
- Last 12 Months
- Year to Date
- Custom Range

### Filtering

Analytics views provide specific filtering capabilities:
- Project type filtering
- Material type filtering
- Customer segment filtering
- Date range filtering

### Chart Types

The system supports multiple visualization types:
- Pie charts for distribution analysis
- Bar charts for comparison analysis
- Line charts for trend analysis
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis

2. Check that the target module is properly loaded
3. Verify that the navigation path is correctly configured
4. Refresh the application if navigation appears unresponsive

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Refreshes**: Refresh the dashboard at the start of your session for the latest data
2. **Analytical Workflow**: Use dashboard KPIs to identify areas needing attention, then drill down with analytics views
3. **Action Prioritization**: Use the upcoming deadlines section to prioritize daily tasks
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly review analytics insights to identify business improvement opportunities
5. **Custom Date Ranges**: Use custom date ranges in analytics views for period-specific analysis

## Technical Implementation

For developers extending the dashboard:

1. The `DashboardView` class in `gui/views/dashboard/main_dashboard.py` serves as the main controller
2. Each section is created by a dedicated method for maintainability
3. The `load_data()` method coordinates data retrieval from all services
4. The `update_dashboard()` method refreshes all UI elements with current data
5. The analytics integration is handled through navigation methods that connect to analytics views

## Data Services

### Primary Data Sources

The dashboard connects to the following services to retrieve its data:

| Service | Interface | Purpose |
