Phase 1 Documentation: Foundation & Basic Reporting
1. Overview
Phase 1 of the Leatherworking ERP Reporting System has been completed, establishing the foundation for all future reporting capabilities and delivering the first inventory stock level report. This phase focused on creating a robust architecture that can be extended in subsequent phases.
2. Implemented Components
2.1 Base Report Infrastructure
A flexible and extensible reporting framework has been created, centered around the BaseReportView class. This class provides:

Standardized report layout with header, filter section, and content area
Date range selection with preset options (today, this month, last 30 days, etc.)
Filter application and reset functionality
Status updates and user feedback
Integration with export utilities

The date range selector component (DateRangeSelector) provides an intuitive interface for selecting report time periods, with various preset options to simplify user interaction.
2.2 Export Utilities
The export_utils.py module provides functionality for exporting reports to various formats:

PDF export capability with customizable filename
Print functionality with formatted output
Utilities for standardized filename generation
Error handling and user feedback

While the current implementation uses placeholder code for actual PDF generation and printing, the architecture is in place to integrate with PDF generation libraries like ReportLab in future phases.
2.3 Inventory Stock Level Report
The first report implemented is the Inventory Stock Level Report (StockLevelReport), which provides:

Overview of current inventory levels by material type
Filtering by material type, inventory status, and quantity
Color-coding for low stock and out-of-stock items
Summary statistics including total items, total value, and stock alerts
Sortable columns for customized data viewing

For demonstration purposes, the report currently uses sample data, but is designed to connect with the actual inventory service in a production environment.
2.4 Module Organization
The reporting module is structured for easy navigation and extension:

Base classes in base_report_view.py
Report implementations in category-specific files (e.g., inventory_reports.py)
Export utilities in export_utils.py
Module registration in __init__.py

This organization allows for easy addition of new report types and categories in future phases.
3. Technical Details
3.1 Dependencies
The reporting system makes use of the following components from the existing codebase:

The GUI framework (Tkinter and ttk)
Custom widgets like EnhancedTreeview and EnumCombobox
Database models and enumerations
Dependency injection system

3.2 Extension Points
The reporting framework is designed with extension in mind:

New report types can be created by extending BaseReportView
Additional export formats can be added to ReportExporter
New filters can be implemented by overriding create_filters and related methods
Report visualizations can be enhanced with charting libraries in future phases

3.3 Known Limitations
Current limitations that will be addressed in future phases:

Reports use sample data rather than connecting to the actual database
PDF export and printing use placeholder implementations
Date picker functionality is not fully implemented (currently just logs a message)
Limited visualization options (tabular data only, no charts yet)

4. Usage Guide
4.1 Accessing Reports
Reports can be accessed through the reporting module's registry:
pythonCopyfrom gui.views.reports import get_report_view_class

# Get a report class by ID
report_class = get_report_view_class("inventory_stock_level")

# Create an instance in a container
report_view = report_class(parent_widget)
4.2 Creating New Reports
To create a new report:

Create a new class that extends BaseReportView
Override create_filters to add custom filtering options
Override create_report_content to define the report's display
Implement load_report_data to fetch and process the report data
Register the report in AVAILABLE_REPORTS in __init__.py

4.3 Exporting Reports
Reports can be exported using the built-in functionality:
pythonCopy# From within a report class:
self.export_pdf()  # Exports to PDF
self.print_report()  # Sends to printer
5. Next Steps
In Phase 2, we will:

Complete the inventory reporting suite with valuation and usage reports
Implement sales reports including revenue analysis and product performance
Add basic project status reports
Enhance PDF export with proper formatting and styling
Add Excel export capability
Integrate with actual database services for live data

6. Conclusion
Phase 1 has successfully established the foundation for the reporting system and delivered the first functional report. The architecture is robust and extensible, setting the stage for the more advanced reporting features to be implemented in subsequent phases.
